**Bitcoin terminal tracker** is a terminal app which allow you to track bitcoin price from your terminal. In this version (`V1.2`) I changed its name to **OXTracker** ðŸ˜„, this terminal app (maybe `tool`) have all of these features:

- **`Bitcoin` Price Chart** - this chart changed its `base-color` to `green` or `red` when bitcoin price increase or decrease.
- **Alert system** - notice you when bitcoin price changed or get error in `getCryptoPrice` process.
- **`Bitcoin` Logger** - print `bitcoinPrice` and how many it changed.
- **Network Speed** - check your network speed and log it in `networkSpeed` window(box).
- **Draggable Windows** - you can drag boxes or windows and move it to other side.

### [Draggable Boxes]()
As you see, you can drag your box and move to other side, It's mean you can set your window as you want.
